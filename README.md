# webtemplate_starter
starter template for sitebuild




The Star Rating component should display a set of stars that can be clicked or hovered over to select a rating.
The component should be customizable, with an option to change the number of stars to be displayed.
When the user clicks on a star to select a rating, the rating should be updated, and a corresponding message should be displayed.
The component should ensure that hovering over the third star after selecting the fourth star highlights only the first, second and third stars.
Show the hover state of all the elements.
The component should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.
Make this landing page look as close to the design as possible.
Brownie Points
The component should allow users to select half-ratings (e.g., 4.5 stars).
